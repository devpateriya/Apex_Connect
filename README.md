Apex Connect
Live Demo: [Link to be added after deployment]

I built Apex Connect as a full-featured CRM to manage client relationships, track business activities, and streamline sales workflows. It's a complete web application with a Java Spring Boot backend and a dynamic Thymeleaf frontend.

The main goal of this project was to build a real-world application from the ground up, handling everything from database design and security to the user interface.

What it Can Do
User & Role Management: Different employees (admins, managers, standard users) have different permissions.

Full Client Lifecycle: You can add new leads, update their status, and manage them as they become customers.

Data Tools: Easily import client lists from a CSV or export search results as a PDF.

Contracts & Events: Create and manage client contracts, and schedule events like meetings or calls.

Notifications: Get reminders for upcoming events.

API Access: A simple REST API is available for interacting with client data.

Tech Stack
Backend: Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Spring Security

Frontend: Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL

Key Libraries: Lombok, OpenCSV, iText

Getting it Running Locally
You'll need Java 8, Maven, and MySQL installed.

Create a new MySQL database for the project.

Update the database name, username, the passwordn/resources/application.properties.

Run the application using the main class in CrmApplication.java.

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:7777.
